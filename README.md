# memory-card-game

##### Final Project for EL ENG X436.2 Java: Discovering Its Power 
###### (Compared to the graded version, a few improvements were made to the version on GitHub)



### Description

The programâ€™s goal is to simulate the Memory Card Game. The game start by initiating a gameboard with all cards faced down and randomly
placed. Player gets to turn over any two cards. If the two cards match, they remain unchanged. Otherwise, the cards revert to their
original state. After all cards are opened, the total of number of cards opened during the game will be shown. Player may replay to try to 
improve their records.

### Main Features

Using JavaFX, the game would have a GUI with the following features:
+ New Game/Exit buttons
+ 6X6 gameboard 
+ 18 different pairs of identical cards

### Author and acknowledgement
The program was designed, written and tested by Phuoc Tan Dang.

I would like to send my regards to my two instructors, Mr. Carl Limsico and Mr. Hoang To. While Mr. Carl directly guided me throughout the course, 
I also reflected a lot on Mr. Hoang's lessons to find new insights while doing the course's exercises and final project. Once again, thank you both.
